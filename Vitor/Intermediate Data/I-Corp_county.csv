7,"The team proposes to leverage the widely-available and inexpensive personal glucose meter (PGM) and enable it for the detection of non-glucose targets with a particular focus on the glycated hemoglobin HbA1c in diabetic patients. While numerous sensors have been proposed and reported in the literature, few sensors have been commercialized for on-site and real-time quantitative detection of a wide-range of targets at home and in the field. Perhaps the most successful of such sensors is the PGM as a result of > 30 years of scientific research and engineering effort. However, PGMs can detect only a single target--glucose. Taking advantage of a recent breakthrough in the PI's group in demonstrating the use of functional DNA (DNAzymes and aptamers) conjugated to an enzyme invertase, the team can now enable any PGM to detect a wide range of targets from recreational drugs like cocaine to disease markers like interferon-gamma of tuberculosis to toxic metal ions like uranium.  The team proposes to translate this NSF-supported fundamental research into marketable products by focusing on developing a new at-home test for diabetic patients while taking advantage of an existing platform and established distribution channel.

While glycated hemoglobin HbA1c is a clinically proven marker for diabetic patients, testing for it is mostly administered in central labs. The combination of a PGM with functional DNA is a simple and novel application that can revolutionize the way people perform at-home and in-field tests, making medical diagnostics significantly easier and cheaper. If the team is successful with this first application, the same technology can be expanded into dozens of new assays for other targets such as infectious diseases and human cancer and heavy metal ions and pathogens in water and food, all of which leverage the same commonly available PGMs. In making the technology easily accessible to the public through the widely available PGM, this project will make it possible to realize the potential of personal medicine.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,352 HENRY ADMINISTRATION BLDG,URBANA,US,Champaign,IL13,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,61801,47.084,9,28,2011,41544081,50000,6,30,2012,4900,I-Corps,50000,1158781,Yi  Lu,600 South Mathews Ave.,Urbana,US,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,618013602,yi.lu@utexas.edu,Yi,Lu,,5124711542,@nsf.gov,10/1/2011,I-Corps:  Portable sensors using the widely available personal glucose monitor,Grant,41544081,,,Urbana,IL13,IL,,,,,"As part of the NSF I-Corps program, a team comprised of the principal investigator, a mentor and an entrepreneurial lead was assembled to test the idea of leveraging the widely available and inexpensive glucose meter for the detection of non-glucose targets. The project took advantage of a recent breakthrough in the PIÃs group which demonstrated the use of an unmodified, off the shelf glucose meter to detect a wide range of targets from recreational drugs like cocaine to disease markers like interferon-gamma of tuberculosis to toxic metal ions like uranium. Because of the simplicity of the system, it can be used in any point-of-care setting such as at home, in clinics, in retail stores, in the third world, or at emergency sites. The team proposed to translate this NSF-supported fundamental research into marketable products by focusing on developing new at-home tests while taking advantage of an existing platform and an established distribution channel.

Through the rigorous training of the I-Corps program, the team learned the importance of customer development (vs. product development). By getting out of the building and talking to potential customers, we identified pitfalls in our initial business plan hypothesis and markets and were able to pivot into a much more viable market. Based on these results, we formed a new startup company called GlucoSentient, Inc. with the PI as the founder, the Mentor as the CEO and the Entrepreneurial Lead as CTO. A consultant, who has extensive experience in developing in vitro diagnostic devices, also joined the company as Chief Medical Officer.  The new company has applied and received a Phase I SBIR grant from the National Science Foundation; and with this award the GlucoSentient team is developing a prototype to demonstrate that the technology can be translated from a lab-based demonstration into a more end-user friendly device. In addition, the student team from GlucoSentient has participated in the Cozad New Venture competition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and they won the Burrill Best Digital Healthcare Application. The event has brought public attention to the newly formed company as well as a $10,000 award. The company also received an I-Start grant from the University of Illinois Research Park called EnterpriseWorks, which provides a highly subsidized level of startup services (legal and accounting) through approved providers in Champaign, IL.


 These project outcomes have made it possible for the project team to translate NSF-supported research into commercial products and to make the technology easily accessible to the public through widely available glucose meters; and such a technology will play a key role in realizing the potential of personal medicine, which will aid disadvantaged neighborhoods in the US and other parts of the world. Through this process, we have also trained a new generation of students to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.

21,"Influencing consumer behavior through information is one of the goals of persuasive technology. This project is to design the presentation and timing of choices on restaurant-ordering interfaces to influence diner behavior. Using proprietary algorithms, the team will make personalized meal recommendations based both on a diner's profile and on their past ordering behavior.  The algorithms evolved from previous NSF funded research on providing diners with in-the-moment nutritional advice. It is believed that sophisticated diner-computer interfaces, backed by intelligent recommendation engines, will improve a restaurant operator's bottom line and deliver a superior ordering experience for diners. For example, in a recent study the team deployed a self-service ordering terminal at a Quick Service Restaurant that recommended food combinations based on a diner's health goal. Goals might be to lose weight, build muscle or manage diabetes. The result was increased sales for the restaurant by increasing the individual ticket amount for diners using the system. The current project aims to improve the quality of the health-based recommendations made by the system by personalizing them further on the basis of a diner?s past ordering history. Existing Point-of-Sale systems focus on reducing operating costs associated with running a restaurant. The team has an opportunity to supply the restaurant industry with front-end technologies that instead focus on increasing restaurant sales by making contextually relevant meal recommendations to diners. 

This project has the potential to influence all the orders placed in a restaurant or cafeteria setting including those placed through web and mobile interfaces.  According to the National Restaurant Association there were 960,000 restaurant locations in the USA in 2010. CNN reported that, on average, Americans visited a restaurant 193 times in that year. A survey by the National Restaurant Association found that nutrition is a top consumer trend. Study results indicate that providing diners with healthy food suggestions through such ordering interfaces can have a huge impact on the current obesity and diet-related chronic disease epidemic. Consumer demand is not the only driver of this trend; new federal guidelines that will go into effect in December of 2011 mandate that all chain restaurants with more than 20 locations provide complete nutritional information on all of their standard menu items.  Ordering at a restaurant generates significant data about consumer dining behavior that is either not captured or is captured but never utilized. The proposed self-service ordering terminals (SmartMenus) capture anonymized diner data, which is easily available for commercial and academic research.",NSF,4900,GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION,926 DALNEY ST NW,Atlanta,US,Fulton,GA05,Georgia Tech Research Corporation,GA,30332,47.084,9,28,2011,97394084,50000,9,30,2012,4900,I-Corps,50000,1158766,Elizabeth D Mynatt,225 NORTH AVE NW,Atlanta,US,Georgia Institute of Technology,303320002,mynatt@cc.gatech.edu,Elizabeth,Mynatt,D,4048947243,@nsf.gov,10/1/2011,I-Corps:  SmartMenu,Grant,97394084,,,Atlanta,GA05,GA,,,,,"Our team received the ICorps award based on our previous NSF funded research on providing diners with in-the-moment nutritional advice and the study of their decisions in response to a controlled variation in the presentation and timing of the available choices on the menu. Our hypothesis at the commencement of the ICorps program was that sophisticated diner-computer interfaces, backed by intelligent recommendation systems had the potential to improve a restaurant operatorÃs business income and deliver a superior ordering experience for diners. Our market thesis was that conventional Point-of-Sale systems were mainly focused on decreasing the operating costs associated with running a restaurant and we could differentiate our product by providing front-end technologies that focused solely on increasing restaurant sales through proprietary suggestive-selling algorithms, that would provide personalized meal recommendations as per a dinerÃs profile or past ordering behavior.

During the ICorps program we used a hypothesis validation strategy (Customer Discovery) to test the various assumptions about our business with potential customers, partners and subject matter experts. We used the business model canvas developed by the Business Model Foundry as the communication and collaboration tool for this purpose. From the nine areas on the canvas we uncovered critical information in our interviews about our potential channels, customer relationships and customer segments. Conversations with restaurant owners revealed that they expected to buy a product like ours from existing Point-Of-Sale providers. This pointed to the possibility of channel partnerships with POS providers to reach meaningful scale in the restaurant market. Upon further enquiry into POS providers we discovered that the POS market was segmented in a way that the top tier providers (3-4 companies) covered 50-60% of the restaurant market. We found that they were difficult to partner with because of their large size and tier 2 and tier 3 POS providers were a better fit for our channel partnership needs. In our conversations with them we discovered that important motivators for them were residual commissions from the payment processed on our product (1-3% per transaction) and a large share of the annual support revenue generated for our products from their existing and new customers. This drove the design of our customer relationship model, which consisted of Activation, Monthly Subscription and Annual Support fees, all of which would be revenue-shared with our POS channel partners. Finally, with regards to our customer segment research we found that the Fast Casual Chain segment of the restaurant market was the best fit for our business because it attracted a more health-conscious demographic as compared to the other segments (Quick Service and Fine Dining).    

An Atlanta based LLC was founded by the entrepreneurial lead based on the results of the original NSF funded research and the findings from the ICorps program. The company developed the SmartMenu software and received a licensing agreement for it from Office of Technology Licensing at Georgia Institute of Technology. Subsequent funding for the venture was raised from an early customer ($100k) and a non-dilutive multiphase commercialization grant ($75k) from the Georgia Research Alliance. In Year 1 the company signed up four multi-unit Fast Casual customers through their first channel partner. This was followed in Year 2 by three new customers through a second POS channel partner. Currently the original angel investor who joined the management team in 2013 leads the company.

11,"The main objective of this project is to develop and implement a new model for sustainable, cost-, energy- and resource-efficient nitrogen removal using the process of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Anammox presents a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternate for biological nitrogen removal (BNR) relative to conventional approaches, which rely upon sequential nitrification and denitrification. Additionally, anammox bacteria by themselves do not produce nitrous oxide, thereby resulting in a lower greenhouse footprint of anammox BNR processes. The primary focus of this project is the development and application of a new model of wastewater treatment based on anaerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas, using the anammox process. Specifically, this project aims develop the design configurations, monitoring and control tools that could enable widespread improvements to the current wastewater treatment infrastructure by systematic application of anammox. 

The adequate management of nitrogen pollution is a significant societal and technological challenge. The USEPA is now considering enforcing more widespread implementation of BNR across the nation in an effort to improve water quality. However, BNR processes are rather energy and resource intensive. Therefore, if not optimally designed and implemented, BNR processes might place an inordinate burden upon the nation's already strained resources. This project plans to develop and implement anammox based process technologies, to ensure that water quality objectives are not in conflict with energy and resource needs.",NSF,4900,"TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE","202 LOW LIBRARY 535 W 116 ST MC 4309,",NEW YORK,US,New York,NY10,Columbia University,NY,10027,47.084,9,20,2012,49179401,50000,9,30,2013,4900,I-Corps,50000,1261062,Kartik  Chandran,2960 Broadway,New York,US,Columbia University,100276902,kc2288@columbia.edu,Kartik,Chandran,,2128549027,@nsf.gov,10/1/2012,I-Corps:  Development of the Next Generation Wastewater Treatment Technologies and Infrastructure,Grant,49179401,,,New York,NY10,NY,,,,,"Using support from this NSF I-Corps project,  the PI Dr. Chandran developed a business canvas for the commercialization of a new model for cost and energy efficient water infrastructure. 

Briefly, the water and energy cycles are inextricably linked. Energy is required to purify water and in the US, significant amounts of water are needed for energy production. 

Based on a separate NSF CBET project, Dr. Chandran is developing a new model for reducing the energy and cost associated with current water infrastructure models.  This NSF I-Corps project facilitated the development of a commerical vehicle to dissemminate this new model and the technologies that form the basis for this model.  Specifically, as part of this NSF I-Corps project a business model for the effective implementation of novel bioprocess technologies for biological nitrogen removal as well as sustained biological monitoring were developed. 

This NSF I-Corps project supported the professional development of a post-doctoral scientist in Prof. Chandran's research group.  Notably, this NSF I-Corps project provided a new dimension of entrepreneurship to the PI and post-doctoral scientist working on the project.  This NSF I-Corps project is expected to have a lasting impression on the PI's thinking and permeate into his technology development and commercialization activities for several years to come.

60,"This I-Corps team plans to further develop a software tool that takes x86 binary programs as input (including stripped binaries), and produces equivalent source-code programs in C. The binary can be compiled from any language. The output C code is not the same as the original source code, but is functionally equivalent. The output C code is fully functional: it can be modified, recompiled, and run as needed. Alternately, the software can output a rewritten binary, or the intermediate representation (IR) of the open-source LLVM compiler, allowing further analysis and transformation of binary code with existing or new LLVM passes. The software developed by the team is able to perform deep binary analysis where the output code is high-level, containing symbols, functions, arguments, return values, types (including aggregate types), and there are high-level control flow constructs, and an abstract stack. Alias analysis and type recovery schemes have been developed that work synergistically to do effective alias analysis on binary code, and recover types including aggregate types like structures and arrays. The team has also developed technologies to rewrite stripped binaries (i.e., those without relocation and symbolic information).

With further development this software tool may be a valuable tool for the recovery of source code from legacy binaries. Both in government and industry, legacy code is run every day, but its source code is often hard to track or lost, given that the original code vendor may have gone through corporate mergers, reorganization or liquidations. Re-developing code from scratch can be costly and difficult to replicate as the full scope of the original functionality is often unknown. In these cases, this software tool may be able to provide source code that can be understood, maintained, updated and recompiled with newer compliers and for newer versions of the x86 instruction set. Additionally, this tool may have applications in forensics to examine and understand the behavior of vulnerable or un-trusted code prior to or after a security breach. This goes beyond existing security tools in dynamic binary rewriters or binary analysis tools, which used automated security tools that are useful, but cannot help with the human understanding of un-trusted or vulnerable code.",NSF,4900,"UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",3112 LEE BLDG 7809 REGENTS DR,College Park,US,Prince George's,MD05,"University of Maryland, College Park",MD,207420001,47.084,10,18,2012,790934285,50000,6,30,2013,4900,I-Corps,50000,1265331,Rajeev  Barua,A.V.Williams Building,College Park,US,University of Maryland College Park,207423285,barua@eng.umd.edu,Rajeev,Barua,,3014058137,@nsf.gov,10/1/2012,I-Corps:  Source Recovery from Binaries Using SecondWrite,Grant,3256088,,,,MD,MD,,,,,"The goal of this project was to study the commercial feasibility of research at the University of Maryland on the analysis and transformation of executable computer software. Our software to do this analysis and transformation is called SecondWrite.

Based on almost one hundred interviews during the NSF-funded I-corps (Michigan, Oct - Nov 2012) customer discovery process, we believe that SecondWrite will be a game changer that will dramatically improve the speed, efficiency and efficacy in countering cyber threats.

President Obama recently cited cyber-threats as one of our most serious economic and national security challenges. Cyber-crime costs the US economy billions of dollars and poses a direct threat to our national infrastructure and financial institutions. The losses from theft of intellectual property alone cost American companies around $250 Billion per year.

SecondWrite has the potential to enable orders-of-magnitude productivity improvements across the cyber security spectrum including malware analysis, exposing undesirable behavior in untrusted code and detecting vulnerabilities from proprietary software. SecondWriteÃs innovative techniques result in a precise discovery of features and robust defense measures against the threats. SecondWrite also enables modification and maintenance of legacy software whose source code has been lost.

Consequently, SecondWrite enables a substantially faster, automated, and more detailed analysis of cyber-threats resulting in a more robust defense capability. SecondWrite directly contributes to minimizing losses to the US economy. Better protection of our IP and trade secrets also contributes to minimizing American job losses.

74,"This Innovation Corps project proposed a novel palladium-supported on porous carbon catalysts (PCC). PCCs account for approximately 1/3rd of the catalysts used in the $4.7 billion/year petrochemicals market. An innovative new PCC has been developed under a previous NSF award. Better utilization of expensive palladium coupled to improvements in the carbon support provide the foundation for decreases in the cost and enhancements in the performance of these key catalysts. The proposed program will evaluate the industry relevant properties of the catalysts. Preliminary market analysis and cost estimates of potential industry targets indicate that the cheaper cost and improved properties of this catalyst, coupled to low startup costs, excellent scalability, and potential for further catalyst upgrades, provide the basis for founding a competitive start up catalysis company. This hypothesis will be tested by the team to enable a Go/No Go decision to be made and to identify and develop the appropriate business plan.

The project will have (4) major broader impacts: (1) lower costs and improved energy and materials efficiency in a significant fraction of the petrochemical and fine chemical industries. (2) the materials and methods developed will provide the foundation for significant improvements in automobile catalytic converters, decreasing cost and improving air quality, and in energy storage and utilization (3) develop skills in the graduate student and faculty member participating in transitioning pure and applied research from the laboratory into the market place (4) result in sharing of the curriculum content with other potential entrepreneurs within the institution.",NSF,4900,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA,301 ROSE ADMIN BLDG,Tuscaloosa,US,Tuscaloosa,AL07,University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,AL,354870001,47.084,3,13,2012,45632635,50000,8,31,2013,4900,I-Corps,50000,1237216,Martin G Bakker,,Tuscaloosa,US,University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,354870336,bakker@ua.edu,Martin,Bakker,G,2053489116,@nsf.gov,3/15/2012,I-Corps:  Assessment of Nanostructured Palladium on Carbon Catalysts,Grant,808245794,,,,AL,AL,,,,,"This I-Corps grant was to determine if there was a viable market for the palladium supported on porous carbon catalyst that had been develped by the team at The University of Alabama. And, if a viable market existed, to determine how the product might best be brought to market. 

During the course of the grant a number of test reactions of interest to industry were carried out that showed the University of Alabama catalyst was superior to commercial catalysts tested for the same reaction.  The University of Alabama catalyst was found to be as much as sixty times more efficient for a given amount of platinum than commercial catalysts tested.  From interviews with a wide range of potential customers it was determined that there was interest in the market place in a new catalyst with better properties than those of existing catalysts.  These interviews also gave an overview of the market for palladium on carbon catalysts.  The market was broken into a number of different customer segments with somewhat different needs.  Large manufacturers placed a premium on selectivity and activity coupled to high throughput.  Smaller manufacturers required both selectivity and activity, but did not place the same emphasis on throughput.  The interviews indicated the existence of significant barriers to a new company bringing a new product into the market place.  These included that large volume customers were very risk averse leading to no or only very slow turnover of suppliers, that there were a number of large, entrenched competitors, and that a new supplier in the market place would require significant time to establish credibility. A number of business models were studied for how the product could be brought into the market, including manufacturing on small scale and partnering with existing companies.

            Other activities in the project included the filing of a patent on the palladium on carbon catalyst and the founding of ThruPore Technologies LLC, a start up company to commercialize the technology.  Participants in the project, including the graduate and undergraduate students gained significant experience in applied research and development, in market research and business development and in presenting scientific research to a non-technical audience.  This experience has already impacted efforts at The University of Alabama to develop entrepreneurial skills in science and engineering majors.

81,"Researchers are developing a human-machine synergism in which the machine complements human weaknesses to being innovative while the human returns the favor for the machine. This method called Innovation Assistance (IA) represents a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation and replaces the minimally successful Artificial Intelligence techniques from the 1980's that were unable to get machines to be innovative by themselves. This is accomplished by carefully understanding the fundamental axis upon which all innovation turns: every innovative solution is based upon at least one overlooked (i.e., obscure) feature of the problem. Humans and machines have different reasons for overlooking obscure features. Each partner in the human-machine interaction will help counter the other?s weaknesses. Researchers have thus far devised nearly two dozen innovation techniques that counteract the many cognitive reasons why humans overlook obscure features. 

This technology has applications for STEM education, lawyers, the military and engineers. The problem-solving model used in this method has the potential to be used to alter innovative education in STEM fields. Techniques developed through IA will be able to more efficiently search databases for similar solutions to an entered problem. There is potential for this technology to be used in a military setting for training forces to be more innovative problem solvers in the field.

Engineering companies need to find technology that either already accomplishes the problem they are working on or could be adapted to the problem they are working on. Our patent-pending search algorithm can automatically find adaptable solutions to a given problem from diverse fields taking into account the variations in the way that the problem can be described. Companies have also expressed an interest in being able to search their history of company projects (i.e., legacy data) in order to find past projects that may have already solved a part of or the whole of their current problem.

In current work, they are creating ""functional tissue barbs"" by modifying tissue barb materials with rose bengal. Rose bengal is a biocompatible material that has been used to facilitate tissue bonding and wound sealing after photoactivation by green light. Resources from the I-Corps project will support two photon polymerization/micromolding of polymeric tissue barbs containing photoactivated tissue bonding agents as well as characterization of functional tissue barbs using biological, mechanical, and functional (e.g., cadaveric swine skin joining) studies. 

Wound site inflammation and scar formation are complications that are associated with conventional wound closure materials. An indirect rapid prototyping approach that involves a combination of two photon polymerization and micromolding will be used for high-throughput replication of functional tissue barbs from rose bengal-modified polymers. These barbs must exhibit biocompatibility and appropriate mechanical properties for clinical use. Functional tissue barbs containing photoactivated tissue bonding agents will be inexpensively produced using two photon polymerization and micromolding for use by medical practitioners in a variety of clinical settings, from the primary care physician's office to the surgical suite.

We are also working to disseminate the results of our research activities to young people and other members of the broader community via monthly Science Saturday events as well as annual festivals at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in downtown Raleigh.

111,"Researchers intend to further develop a static program analysis tool chain. The analysis chain is comprised of the following tools:
- A static analyzer for MATLAB models
- A static analyzer of Android programs
- A static analyzer for detecting program termination

The proposed effort may lead to wider availability of a high performance static analysis toolkit for embedded software that outperforms existing tools in (1) being able to uncover software flaws resulting from deep logical errors, (2) having lesser percentage of false positives, (3) providing on-demand property-specific checkers, (4) bridging the gaps between the various abstraction levels in the software design cycle - from requirements (application-dependent checking) all the way down to code (application independent checking), and (5) providing correctness proofs for successfully checked code.

If successful, the proposed effort can lead to wider acceptance of static program analysis tools in the mainstream embedded systems programming community. It could lead to better understanding of usability issues concerning static program analysis tools among less mathematically sophisticated users. The wider deployment of high-performance static program analysis tools as a result of the proposed effort can lead to development of safer and more secure embedded systems.

In between, the team attended weekly conference calls. 


We have used the experience and the scientific methodology learnt during the ICorps program in trying to commercialize a video activity recognition tool that we have developed as part of  a grant funded by the Army Research Office (ARO). Following the scientific methodology learnt during the ICorps program enabled us to win the support from the State of Louisiana LIFT (Leveraging Innovation for Technology Transfer) fund for working towards the commercialization of the video analytics technology.

Using the techniques learned in the Icorps program, we also commercialized (through a startup) a technology that uses deep learning techniques for automatically predicting failures in manufacturing machines. The product is currently undergoing beta testing with a customer.

 

The PI has been teaching CSC 3380 (Object Oriented Design)  at LSU in Spring and Fall. One of the significant components in this course is a semester long project.   We attempted to transfer the knowledge acquired during the ICorps project to this course. In particular we had students, as part of their projects, develop a software startup following the lean startup model. Students were divided into startup teams of three  (or four) members each. Each team was asked to come up with an idea of a software product that would address one or more possible market segments and would address a possible customer's painpoint (the hypothesis). They were then asked to start with a business model canvas and an MVP (a mockup or an initial prototype) and use the scientific procedure based on customer discovery to generate data that would help refine the product as well as the commercialization strategy. Through a series of iterations each of which resulted in modification, addition/deletion of pivots, the student teams came up with a modified product and commercialization strategy. An agile  software engineering process was then used to build this product. Throughout the development, scientific procedure based on customer discovery was used to ensure that all assumptions/hypothesis undergo testing and the ``right product"" is developed while proper software engineering principles made sure that the product was ``developed right"".

125,"Snow is an important component of both regional and global climate systems, as well as a critical storage component in the hydrologic cycle. Of particular interest is the snow water equivalent (SWE) which considers both depth and density. However, the methods and sensors currently available to measure SWE, or even just snow depth, are either restricted to a single point or expensive (e.g., aircraft based methods.)  An emerging option for remotely determining snow depth is the utilization of existing networks of GPS base stations, as is currently being investigated by CU professors Kristine M. Larson (PI), Eric E. Small (co-PI), Mark W. Williams and Dennis M. Akos under NSF grants. Multipath, the reflection of signals off the ground and other nearby surfaces, is here used to estimate the snow depth over a comparably large area. However, this method has two drawbacks. A survey-grade basestation including receivers and antennas is expensive, around $20k, and since geodesy-type antennas are designed to mitigate low elevation signals the resulting quality of the estimates suffers compared to what could be offered by a custom solution. To overcome this, this project proposes the development and marketing of a snow sensor based on a mass-market GPS receiver coupled with a custom antenna, that potentially can be produced at low cost in reasonable quantities. The sensor also has the potential to be used to estimate soil moisture content and vegetation growth.

At present, available snow depth information is temporally and/or spatially limited, the knowledge about the current state of the snow water equivalent potentially available for runoff is similarly limited. Thus, a widely-deployed network of affordable and accurate wide area snow sensors will increase the knowledge and understanding of the hydrologic cycle and potentially improve both climate and weather models. Furthermore, it may also prove valuable for water management facilities where snow levels are an important source of information when predicting droughts. Also, farmers and the tourism industry are also likely to benefit from the information this sensor can provide.  It is possible that soil moisture and vegetation growth can also be measured with the snow sensor, however additional research effort will be required to assess the full capabilities. The prototypes and production units will ""call home"" with the raw data rather than provide measurements directly. The users can then access processed estimates online. This has several benefits; it offers a convenient method of accessing data, it allows for refinement of the algorithms as more data and insight becomes available and it is also possible, at the users' discretion, to make the data available to the scientific community.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, THE",3100 MARINE ST STE 481 572 UCB,Boulder,US,Boulder,CO02,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,803090001,47.084,7,2,2012,7431505,50000,12,31,2013,4900,I-Corps,50000,1249009,Dennis M Akos,572 UCB,Boulder,US,University of Colorado at Boulder,803090572,dma@colorado.edu,Dennis,Akos,M,3037352987,@nsf.gov,7/1/2012,I-Corps:  A low cost GPS snow sensor,Grant,7431505,,,Boulder,CO02,CO,,Staffan  Backen,,,"This project explored the commercial potential of snow sensing instrument using GPS reflections.  The potential for snow measurements is well understand and being exploited using the network of GPS reference stations.  This project explored using mass market GPS engines to achieve snow depth measurements.  Focus for this particular project was the commercial interest in such technology and the requirements which would be placed on the sensor itself.  A number of potential customers and partners were interviewed and helped to refine the design and marketing of the technology.

There is interest in using such technology in the commercial marketplace but there still exist technical questions which need to be addressed.  The most significant of these is the performance.  The sensor has been shown to work and is an accurate measure of snow depth.  Further, the low cost component is quite evident from the effort (and is a critical component for the marketplace).  However, more extensive testing is required for different types (densities) of snow as well as corresponding terrain.

Current efforts are involved with long term testing of the sensor in various regions/environments to get a better understand of the potential and, consequently, the resulting market for the technology.  If tests are successful, then it is expected a commercial prototype will be available in 2015 with a refined variant in 2016.

118,"The proposed innovation uses microfluidic technology to rapidly generate fluid mixtures of drugs with fine increments in their proportions to assist with combination drug development. Although automated pipetting systems and well plates have been the workhorse for primary drug screening where thousands of individual compounds are tested, few, if any, are flexible for screening combination drugs because of the complexity involved in scanning a large number of drug-and-dose combinations. This technology involves injecting plugs of drug solutions into a uniquely designed microfluidic device that allows autonomous mixing and dilution. This approach allows mixing drugs in very fine increments with significantly less consumption of drug samples and reagents. 

Development of a microfluidic drop technology for combination drug discovery may accelerate the process of drug screening and discovery of new or combination drugs. It would help to reduce the drug development time cycle and cost as it facilitates fluid mixtures of drugs in very small increments.

The technology is capable of testing drugs using compound volumes that are about one thousand times less than what is currently required in the pharmaceutical industry. Such tiny compound volumes can lead to significant cost savings in the early stages of drug discovery, where tens of thousands of compounds are screened to identify the lead candidate drugs. 

One hundred interviews were conducted with people in the drug industry to identify the steps that are most time consuming in the drug screening process. Discussions were held with scientists in the pharma industry as well as researchers in contract research organizations and academic high throughput drug screening centers. These discussions led to the identification that reduction in compound volumes is the main value that the technology can bring to the industry.

The project led to training of one graduate student and the PI in entrepreneurship and exposed them to the significance of innovation in the commerical arena. The technology has been licensed to a startup company which could generate new jobs and workforce. If the start up company is successful it may lead to translating a new drug screening technology to the market place, enabling significant reduction in drug development costs and also discovering new and effective drugs.

130,"The objective of the proposed work is to develop a low-cost and wireless enabled 'Microwave Stethoscope' system that can continuously monitor human vital signs from a single reflection coefficient measurement. These vital signs include the heart rate, breathing rate, stroke volume, and more importantly the changes in lung water content which is unique to our sensor. The system is based on the use of a single miniaturized microwave sensor placed on the patient chest for reflection coefficient measurements. This broadband microwave sensor is attached to the body in a similar fashion to an EKG lead. The measured reflection coefficient (specifically the phase) exhibits changes due to respiration, hearbeat, and the changes in the lung water content. These vital signs are extracted by a novel digital signal processing algorithm providing multiple vital signs through a single measurement such as heart rate, respiration rate, EKG like heart waveform, and changes in the lung water content. 

Healthcare is, and remains, a pressing challenge facing our nation in the 21st century. The diminishing ratio of the primary care physicians to the population, and the increasing requirements of the aging population are the driving forces for the home and patient centered delivery of healthcare approach. Successful completion of this project could provide a single low-cost and non-invasive sensor that can continuously monitor multiple vital signs, hence, enable improving healthcare in remote and under privileged communities, and in supporting a variety of in-field and emergency military applications. The developed hardware platform can be an investigative tool for further illness diagnosis. This project could enable use of millimeter wave integrated circuits for high accuracy monitoring of human health, and provides a new diagnosis tool to a wide array of medical doctors including epidemiologists, pediatricians, and family physicians.

 A new tool for the early detection of heart failure

Researchers believe it will save lives and result in big savings to health care costs





http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=131816&amp;org=NSF

 





Until recently, a reliable, low-cost, non-invasive method to measure changes that occur in the water content of the lungs did not exist. Yet, having such a device could be an important tool for the early detection of heart failure, which afflicts an estimated 5.1 million Americans and is a leading cause of hospitalization and death.

""There is a significant need,"" says Magdy Iskander, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and director of the Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications of the university's college of engineering, citing additional conditions that potentially could benefit from the new technology, including edema, emphysema, dehydration, blood infection, acute lung injury and the effects of critical burns.

""The impact could be tremendous, particularly for predicting heart failure,"" he says.

Heart failure costs the nation an estimated $32 billion annually, which includes the cost of health care services, medications to treat heart failure, and missed days of work, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, heart failure is a frequent reason patients are readmitted to hospitals within 30 days of their initial discharge.

""Annually more than one million patients are hospitalized due to heart failuree, which accounts for a total Medicare expenditure exceeding $17 billion,"" Iskander says.

The National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded scientist has invented a new type of stethoscope he believes will prompt significant and positive changes for patients suffering from heart failure and other related conditions. It attaches to the body surface much like an EKG sensor--there is no need to implant it--and uses a novel radio frequency (RF) sensor to detect small changes in lung water, and monitor vital signs including heart and respiration rate, and stroke volume. The device uses low level RF signals, two-thirds lower than the average cell phone signal, he says.

Since the lungs normally do contain some water, the idea is to first use the device to obtain a baseline in order to identify future changes, ""before there are problems,"" he says. In hospitals, the stethoscope could be an important component of so-called ""bridge clinics"" that monitor patients after discharge to prevent readmission.

Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare can reduce hospital payments for excessive readmissions. ""Thus hospitals are motivated because now they are penalized when patients come back with heart failure within 30 days,"" he says.

He also envisions its use in ""telemedicine,"" where an internet hookup will connect to a patient wearing the device, and will be able to measure important vital signs remotely, and transmit data on a regular basis, without having to go to the doctor or hospital in person, unless it is necessary.

""The most important thing is that we believe it will help save lives,"" Iskander adds. ""But it also will almost certainly result in big savings in health care costs.""

The cardio-pulmonary stethoscope evolved from research Iskander conducted years ago for the Air Force, when he was studying the effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans and developing safety standards for microwave exposure.

""We were trying to evaluate safe levels, and the biological effects of working with microwaves, and we were exploring the use of microwaves in medical applications,"" he says.

In doing so, he discovered that microwave signals reflect changes in lung water, forming the basis for his invention.

NSF supported Iskander with a $50,000 Innovation Corps (I-Corps) grant, awarded in 2013, which supports a set of activities and programs that prepare scientists and engineers to extend their focus beyond the laboratory into the commerc..."

Decentralized, portable, or point-of-use water treatment products have attracted attention of diverse customer segments in recent years. Graphene-based nanomaterials have recently shown excellent features as adsorbents of heavy metals, antibacterial, and non-toxic effect to humans. In this present project, we investigated the commercialization potential of our newly developed graphene-oxide nanocomposite based membrane filters that can simultaneously inactivate microorganisms and remove heavy metals from water.  

Intellectual  Merit. The major benefits of this nanotechnology are twofold. The first one is that it does not generate brines or other toxic disinfectant byproducts like other water treatment methods. The second is that commercial membrane filters currently available in the marketplace are not capable of simultaneous inactivation of microorganisms and removal of heavy metals. In this project, a team of researchers and students under the guidance of established entrepreneurs assessed the commercial viability of the technology and determined ways to effectively commercialize the technology. In this study, the team interviewed more than 140 potential customers (end users) and personnel from the water industry and governmental agencies to better understand the current technological limitations and needs. Our assessments determined that our products will benefit primarily individuals in need of effective on-the-go water filtration systems&mdash;starting with a special focus on travelers, campers &amp; hikers and emergency agencies affiliated with the government.  The segment composed of travelers were determined to be individuals between 20 and 65 years old going to developing countries where water is the leading cause of health problems. Campers &amp; hikers (ages between 18 and 45) were also considered another segment of interest for our technology, since they need reliable, effective, simple and inexpensive product to purify water. Further investigations also determined that emergency governmental agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Red Cross, could benefit tremendously from our technology since they provide emergency supplies to large populations in the United States, as well as to other countries in need during major natural disasters or catastrophes. During this project, we also compared our technology with the current products on the market. It was determined that our competitorsÃ products were not able to remove simultaneously microorganisms and heavy metals from water, furthermore most of them were expensive, bulky and required either physical effort or chemicals to treat the water.  In summary, the present water treatment nanotechnology has been shown to be inexpensive and potentially transformative, since if commercialized, it would benefit billions of people worldwide and revolutionize the current technologies in portable water treatment systems.  

Broader Impact. Despite the technological advancements in water treatment and new water sources, more than 3 billion people around the world suffer from waterborne infection and contamination. Providing access to safe drinking water to these people will yield great health and socioeconomic benefit.

Entrepreneurial Lead: Dr. Wasim Barham

 

Our I-Corp program team consists of Dr. James P. Werner, Dr. Jon Preston and Dr. Wasim Barham. The program exposed us to the resources and methods for developing a small business startup company through the program developed by Steve Blank and supported by the online management system Launch Pad Central.

As part of the I-Corps program we were to seek out potential clients and industry partners that could offer knowledge and provide strategic information to help us build a business model for marketing our new technology to clients needing our product.

Our technological development consisted of a software package developed for simulating Strength of Materials testing machines for educational purposes. This virtual lab simulation was designed to offer better access to lab course experience, while improving student learning and providing a lower cost option to institutions that lacked access to the industry machines normally used in testing. 

We began our investigations and interview process by interacting with professionals in the gaming industry, and machine manufacturing companies that produced the machines that our virtual lab simulated for engineering education. Over the course of the five-week program, we interviewed 91 professionals from these and other industries, including leaders in academic administration, management from online content management system companies, and professors that would potentially use our software for improved learning and assessments in their field.

We embraced Steve BlankÃs approach to building a startup business, and through this process we underwent a philosophical change in our approach to disseminating our technology to the market. Our initial goal was to market the software to gaming companies who could purchase and refine many of the tools we had developed. We also initially believed that we could market it to the machine manufactures that we thought would package our software with the sale of their machines to universities.

We quickly learned that the gaming companies didnÃt see any financial gain associated with educational game development, and the machine manufacturers saw our developments as a competition rather than an ally in their business ventures.

So we pivoted our focuses towards content management companies and assessment coordinators in higher education who would find value in the tools we built into educational gaming simulations. We discovered that these assessment tools built into the learning interface were highly desirable. These tools could help assess student learning, and gather data about student achievement in academic programs. This information is used for student and program evaluations, and accreditation purposes. We learned that administrators and professors mostly gather this type of information manually and often lack time and access to data to give accurate reports.

The virtual labs weÃve developed have the ability to impact the resources for laboratory learning environments by provide alternative resources for learning experiences. The interface is a complete simulation of the laboratory components, including machines, materials and computer calculation systems. By utilizing these, and future customized versions of the labs that could be developed for engineering and other disciplines based on needs, programs could supplement the physical lab, which would provide extended learning. In the case of programs that are unable to afford or obtain the lab machines, the interface could be used to teach the entire lab at greatly reduced cost to the college. We identified during the I-Corps program that community colleges had significant interests in utilizing this technology to provide courses and materials that are often difficult for these institutions to obtain. In addition, the ability to collect specifi..."
72,"In the so-called big data era, the data in many companies are becoming too big to be processed and stored by traditional computing platforms. There are urgent needs to address the challenge from ever-increasing big data facing these industries, especially for small companies and contractors who do not have large scale computing infrastructure. Those big companies that have the large scale computing infrastructure, are currently using the traditional High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques to handle the big data requirements. However, the traditional HPC techniques were designed to process computation intensive works, instead of data-intensive jobs. Moreover, the traditional HPC requires deep knowledge and expertise in HPC architectures and uses low-level parallel programming models, which typically create an obstacle for the regular users and domain experts to utilize HPC infrastructure directly. This I-Corps team proposes the cloud computing technique that provides a cost-effective solution to address the computation and storage requirements, which is especially useful to small companies and startups.

This project is to explore the commercialization opportunities for a software stack that stores, processes and analyzes big volume of data in a variety of domains, including petroleum seismic data, medical images, retails, energy and more. Besides the scalable performance and fault-tolerance features provided by the software stack, it also provides high-level programming templates, workflow and a domain specific language to simplify the usage of large scale computing platforms. The proposed cloud-based software stack will deliver a customized computing platform service via a user-friendly web interface that is designed to fill the gap between the big data analytics platforms and the customer?s requirements in a variety of domains.

The project provided vital training to the faculty and students of the research lab for entrepreneurship knowledge and significantly transformed the research methodology in the lab. The most valuable outcomes of the project are the entrepreneurship training to the team and the unique marketing experience the team received from conducting 102 interviews with industry professionals. The team collected valuable user's requirements from these interviews and established networks/collaborations with multiple companies, which dramatically enhanced the research lab's capacity. The project provides invaluable training and experience to the PVAMU graduate and undergraduate students who involve into the project and encourages them to explore entrepreneurship in their careers. 

As a result, the lab was awarded by the successive NSF AIR (Accelerate Innovative Research) program to develop a prototype of petroleum data analytics platform with commercialization goal in 2015. The lab has collaborated with experts in Geophysics and industry to develop the seismic data analytics software prototype, which is a pioneer in the field. Moreover, the lab also works with Texas A&amp;M Commercialization Office, and a group of MBA students at the University of Texas-Austin to work on the business plan and commercialization feasibility study for the software package. The software package is currently still under active development, and the lab has demonstrated its functionality in the SEG conference in late 2016. While the team is continuously performing research to address the critical challenges in the industry, the research has been recognized by industry and research community with numerous invited research talks to a variety of communities and companies.  The team will pursue to set up a startup in 2017 to make the research out of the research lab and create a big data analytics software product to the oil &amp; gas industry.

Concern about cyberbullying and cyber-predation among parents and authorities has led to a booming parental control software market and to the passage of anti-cyberbullying laws in many states. The proposed innovation offers better recognition of cyber-abuse and as well as response capabilities; thereby providing a more dynamic, interactive, and empowering resource for youths and their parents.

The team has developed machine learning algorithms that are able to detect approximately 80% of cyberbullying communication, and 84% of predatory conversation. These algorithms were developed using data that was collected and labeled for research purposes. The algorithms need to be adapted for real-time communication, as well as continuously updated as additional data become available. The theoretical model for victim response is in development. The model identifies the type, context and severity of bullying or predation, along with categories of potential responses from which victims can choose.

Unfortunately, youths use this same language online to bully and sexually harass others.  Concern about cyberbullying and cyberpredation among parents and authorities has led to a booming parental control software market and to the passage of anti-cyberbullying laws in many states. Unfortunately, youths continue to be victimized by bullies and sex offenders online. Most cybervictims survive these encounters, but they don?t emerge unscathed and are frequently unprepared to defend themselves against future attacks.

 

The intellectual merits of this project included a detailed analysis of the market for this software and face-to-face discussions with potential consumers and licensees. These activities resulted in the development of a software prototype to showcase the capabilities of our technology to provide dynamic language recognition and effective responses for victims.  The market research and customer interviews also determined that there was little demand for a consumer product.  Instead there was great interest in educational resources, community support, and building cybersafety into social media technologies that are designed for use by children ages 10-16.

 

The broader impacts of our project included the an increased understanding of the current state of the parental control software marketplace, the development of entrepreneurial capabilities at a small liberal arts college, and the development of a community forum (http://www.bullycenter.com) that is designed to develop community support for victims of cyberbullying, as well as their parents, teachers, and other concerned individuals and organizations.

156,"Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) started out as a practice to reduce stress in patients with pain and illnesses. Research into MBSR and its benefits go beyond stress reduction. Practicing MBSR has been shown to provide better focus, possible regulation of cortisol levels, quality of life improvement to name a few. Historically, during cognitive therapies it is important for the patient to practice the tools taught when away from therapy; however, ensuring adherence and correctly applying the tools are often left to the patient, their interpretation, and their memory. This team proposes to take the current online MBSR intervention program and turn it into a mobile application product that will assist clinical treatment and cognitive therapy.  The proposed mobile application may be used by therapists to supplement cognitive therapy training for their patients. 

MBSR is useful for invention on PTSD and other anxiety disorders. The proposed app will help the therapist to connect to clients and track the progress.  It will also ensure that the clients receive sufficient guidance in their daily monitoring and improvement. The app will also be designed into an open system to continuously update and incorporate effective intervention components identified from research.  Many people due to stigma, societal perception, or perhaps lack of access will not come forward for assistance for mental disorders; thus, this mobile application may provide new tools to cope and open the door to further treatment. The core client app development will be built on an agnostic mobile software development platform. Utilizing an agnostic platform build will align the app to be able to be released quickly and seamlessly on multiple mobile operating systems (OS) at or near the same time.

MBSR has been shown to be effective in several areas including reducing anxiety, depression, stress and in the management of chronic pain.  One of our student research participants, a Veteran, wanted to design an MBSR mobile app for stress reduction. It would be designed to be an accessible, anonymous and affordable means for stress reduction. This would be helpful to Veterans who may be reluctant to admit to stress related issues or seek help for those issues.  We were able to complete our NSF ICorps training and use that training to interview customers to find out what problems they needed solved.  

Our research team was able verify cost savings to potential customers and satisfactory problem solutions in the delivery of mobile apps based on a recent review of the literature indicating that similar mobile solutions for stress reduction can yield significant cost savings to both insurers and also to clients in terms of reduced co-pay. We took our concept to the New York City Regional Innovation Node (NYCRIN) poster showcase in July, 2015 in New York at Columbia to share with others and potential investors and funding groups.

After that we were able to develop the first version of our MBSR mobile app and start a randomized study comparing it's performance to an existing mindfulness app developed by the VA.  We presented our preliminary descriptive findings on the first two weeks of this 4-week study at the Eastern Psychological Association Annual Conference  (EPA) in New York, New York in March, 2016.  We are continuing to analyze the data on the first 22 completors in our study and have submitted to present those findings at another conference in the fall. We formed an LLC that is currently being restructured to be the company that provides the research-based mobile app and related services. At this point we have generated some interest from first responder and related groups.

Lastly we applied for a State University of New York Research Foundation (SUNY RF) Technology Accelerator Fund (TAF) award to take the app to the next version on our way to the development of the full-scale app. Ultimately we hope to apply for a National Institute of Health (NIH) award to bring the final app into realization or possibly work with an industry partner to develop the final full-scale app. We hope that all people someday will have access to affordable, effective, evidence-based mobile mental health solutions. Our company will work to integrate mental health and wellness solutions using an accessible, portable and engaging mind-body approach.

75,"To address multi-fold increases in cellular network demand, carrier cell range sizes have shifted downwards to maximize network capacity. In doing so, accurate and fine-grained estimation of coverage becomes a critical issue for spatial reuse, intercell interference, and smooth handoffs between cells. Historically, in-field experimentation has been used by telecommunication companies to estimate wireless propagation characteristics of a given region, which is costly due to the manpower and equipment resources required. The emerging popularity of smartphones offers a far cheaper alternative, recording in-field network observations directly from the cellular users via crowdsourcing. However, crowdsourcing often provides incomplete measurement coverage to accurately infer path loss. Further complicating the issue, different sub-regions can require differing amounts of measurements to achieve the same path loss characterization accuracy. This I-Corps team has developed a system that uses geographical feature information (e.g., building heights, foliage, free space) to predict measurement collection requirements over a region using a statistical learning framework, allowing network operators to optimize their measurement collection strategy.

The proposed work will lower the financial barrier to and increase the assurance of coverage in rolling out new cellular generations and/or frequency bands over a given region of users. The project will also allow increased confidence in leveraging crowd-sourced information from users as opposed to relying on costly drive testing, thereby saving manpower and allowing a quicker feedback loop in terms of network performance. The project will allow the team members to develop commercial acumen that could increase the quality and fidelity of their research as well as train other students at all levels that have intellectual capital that could be commercially viable. By participating in the I-Corps curriculum, this team intends to clearly identify the exact amount current carriers spend, and the amount customers would be willing to pay for the proposed service.",NSF,4900,SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY,6425 BOAZ LANE,Dallas,US,Dallas,TX32,Southern Methodist University,TX,75205,47.084,12,8,2015,1981133,50000,5,31,2016,4900,I-Corps,50000,1600549,Joseph D Camp,6425 BOAZ,Dallas,US,Southern Methodist University,752756312,camp@lyle.smu.edu,Joseph,Camp,D,2147688541,@nsf.gov,12/15/2015,I-Corps: Efficient Terrain-Based Measurement Gathering for Path Loss Inference,Grant,1981133,,,Dallas,TX32,TX,,,,,"Intellectual Merit: There were three main intellectual thrusts to this NSF I-Corps project:





(i) To develop the relationship between geographic features of a particular region and the wireless characteristics with global crowdsourcing, drive testing (especially in unfamiliar types of regions) machine learning. 





(ii) To analytically and empirically quantify the degree to which crowdsourcing can supplant structured drive testing experimentation and quantify the need for additional experimentation where the need may arise. 





(iii) To quantify the economic impact of a purely crowdsourced approach to coverage analysis versus the predominantly used method of physically drive testing a given area for coverage analysis. 

Broader Impacts. There are four primary broader impacts of the project:

(i) To lower the financial barrier to and increase the assurance of coverage in rolling out new cellular generations and/or frequency bands over a given region of users. This is especially important as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) develops and standardizes protocols for the next generation of wireless devices in 5G networks. 

(ii) To allow increased confidence in leveraging crowdsourced information from users as opposed to relying on costly drive testing, thereby saving manpower and allowing a quicker feedback loop in terms of network performance. Part of the work focuses on the balance of accuracy in evaluation versus cost of measurement collection, allowing a holistic cost-benefit analysis to take place for ideal data collection.

(iii) To make strides towards complex but repeatable channel emulation based on geographical features in an actual physical location. Channel emulation is an important tool in wireless research, providing repeatable realistic channels for testing. Geographical context is sorely lacking from existing emulators, precluding dynamic channel emulation on an environmental scale.

(iv) To allow the team members to develop commercial acumen that could increase the quality and fidelity of their research as well as train other students at all levels that have intellectual capital that could be commercially viable. Developing a deep understanding of industry capabilities and need will complement and enrich future research endeavors.





Outcomes. The working local proof-of-concept that shows promising empirical results. To more thoroughly understand the current development stage, the full system can be described as the sum of three separate modules: (i) Data Acquisition, (ii) Prediction Evaluation, and (iii) Application Improvement. The proof-of-concept stage has implementation and validation at each sub module, showing improvement over existing methods where appropriate. For the Data Acquisition module, the measurement set is used to empirically train and test the learning algorithm. For the Prediction Evaluation module, the usable terrain information has been extracted and the appropriate wireless propagation metrics calculatd for classifier training, showing improved class prediction rates than without using terrain information. Finally, for the Application Improvement module, the measurement and time savings in an experimental test-driving scenario yields identical accuracy with 50 percent fewer measurements taken.

227,"Visually impaired (VI) students are challenged with learning highly visual content in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) courses using nonvisual technologies that portray only limited details and cannot be presented in real-time. Though there is a rising number of VI individuals seeking higher educational experiences, just under a third have attained a high school diploma. This situation is exaggerated in STEM fields, where much of the content relies heavily on graphical information presented visually. These unfortunate events are not due to VI individuals being incapable of high academic achievement, but rather, due to inadequate technologies and resources provided to them. Subsequently, there exists a dire need for a portable, refreshable real-time display of graphical information via nonvisual feedback that can be easily integrated within a classroom setting. This Innovation Corps for Learning Team project aims to assess the commercial viability, market potential, and technological impact of touchscreen-based educational curriculum that will enable real-time graphical  information presentation through visual, auditory, and vibratory feedback. The proposed innovation leverages commercially available touchscreens and custom software created in the form of Android applications to translate visual content displayed on-screen into content that can be felt (through vibrations) and heard (through sound). 

The proposed innovation has the potential to bridge this technological gap and open up these new learning opportunities for VI students. 
The infrastructure and software in this work will promote a transformed classroom in which students with VI are independently interacting with their sighted peers and primary classroom teacher, in real-time via touchscreens. Each student would have a touchscreen that is wirelessly networked to their peers' and teacher's touchscreens (or smart board or laptop). As the teacher draws a graph or figure on his or her input device, this same image will immediately ""appear,"" in a multimodal sense, on all of the students' touchscreens. While sighted students may primarily use the visual display of the information, students with VI can leverage vibratory and/or auditory feedback (using headphones) to explore the graphical content. This work lays the foundation for the creation of touchscreen-based educational curriculum in the form of Android applications that will (1) meet the customer need of a portable, multimodal, real-time platform for graphical information presentation, (2) enable classroom integration through the use of existing hardware, and (3) encourage widespread adoption through distribution in online application markets. The impacts of this work will not only address several barriers of graphical information transfer for VI students (a significantly underrepresented population in STEM), but will also lay the foundation for the creation of a universally-designed, learner-centered framework for touchscreens that may benefit all people, enhancing the fidelity and creating new dimensions of learning right at our fingertips.",NSF,4900,SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,"30 CIR DR, SIUE CAMPUS",Edwardsville,US,Madison,IL13,Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville,IL,620260001,47.084,1,5,2015,6331342,50000,8,31,2016,4900,I-Corps,29970,1505361,Jenna  Gorlewicz,,,US,Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville,620261000,jenna.gorlewicz@slu.edu,Jenna,Gorlewicz,,3149778185,@nsf.gov,1/1/2015,I-Corps L:  Real-Time Graphical Presentation for Visually Impaired STEM Students,Grant,143941909,,,Edwardsville,IL13,IL,,,,,
46,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the increasing demand for cell, tissue, and organ preservation which has resulted in a fast-expanding market of biopreservation. Preservative effectiveness largely depends on the technology of biopreservation solutions or media, where the properties and concentrations of the ingredients in the solutions play essential roles. Regular (or conventional) reagents in biopreservation solutions are usually alcohol-based or salt-based, which have considerable drawbacks including low effectiveness, cytotoxicity, and environmental impact. The technology of Antifreeze Polypeptide-Based (AFP) system can overcome the drawbacks of conventional reagents in biopreservation solutions. The I-Corps team will conduct customer-based research that include customer discovery, market research, and exploring commercial applications of AFP-based technology for biopreservation including proof-of-concept studies suggested during customer discovery.

This I-Corps project is focused on a technology to improve biopreservation. Antifreeze polypeptides (AFPs) and certain small molecules are naturally produced by organisms, such as fish, insects, and plants, for their survival in extreme cold environments. AFPs are known to inhibit ice growth by binding to specific ice crystal surfaces. The freezing inhibition by AFPs is non-colligative, which is superior to regular/conventional antifreezes (e.g., sodium chloride, ethylene glycol). Recently, certain small molecules that do not exhibit non-colligative antifreeze properties, but can efficiently enhance the antifreeze effect of AFP over 10 times have been identified. More recently, the role for AFPs in inhibiting the formation of crystals in addition to ice has been revealed. In particular, AFPs can control the crystallization of certain carbohydrates and nucleosides much more effectively (comparing to their role in controlling ice crystallization) where these molecules often act as protectant molecules in biopreservation. Because of its highly effective, eco-friendly, and multifunctional characteristics, the proposed AFP-based system could be a potential advanced technology for biopreservation. The goal of this I-Corps team is to further investigate the value of this technology to the biopreservation market.",NSF,4900,"CAL STATE L.A.

These short preservation times for organs severely limit the number of organs can be transported and transplanted into patients as well as which people can be considered for the organs due to distance and travel. Consequently, the costs for transplantation has been significantly increased, while its lifesaving potential has been diminished. The compositions of preservation solutions used in transplantation usually determine the ischemic time allotted for the organs preserved at low temperatures and the limitations of preservation solutions thus contribute to donor organ shortage.

This I-Corps project focused on the technology of antifreeze polypeptide (AFP)-based system (AFP and enhancer) to improve biopreservation, in particular, organ and tissue preservation. Antifreeze polypeptides (AFPs) and certain small molecules (that can enhance the activity of AFPs, i.e., enhancers) are naturally produced by cold-adapted organisms, such as fish, insects, and plants, for their survival in extreme cold environments. Compared with other preservation solutions, AFP-based system is highly effective, more environmentally friendly, and multifunctional.

In this I-Corps project, we investigated the value of AFP-based system to the biopreservation market, in particular, to organ and tissue preservation, mainly through customer interviews.

We identified potential customers and partners in relevant segments and interviewed more than 100 potential customers and partners for AFP-based system in the field of biopreservation with a focus on organ and tissue preservation. We interviewed people in courier services and organ procurement organizations, surgeons for organ transplant operations, researchers using preserved organ, tissue and biospecimen in universities, hospitals, and biotech companies, as well as key personnel in preservation solution manufacturers.

Through our extensive customer-based research, we have identified that there is an urgent need for improved preservations of organs, tissues, and biospecimens. We also better defined the value propositions and the customer segments in our business model canvas as well as broadened customer relations. We have filed two relevant patent applications during this project period. In the meantime, barriers for the technology transfer and commercialization as well as potential interdisciplinary collaborators and partners to work with in order to fill these knowledge gaps have also been identified. Consequently, we have made the decision to move our effort in developing AFP-based system to improve organ and tissue preservation forward. At the end of this I-Corps project, we have had a detailed plan for this effort to move forward and we are working through the plan.

In summary, this project advanced the development of AFP-based system in biospecimen preservation and impact on other relevant industries, created new opportunities for research, teaching, and mentoring, and broadened participation of women and individuals from under-represented group.

54,"This I-Corps team is geared towards the development of a simple portable microchip device that will be able to detect cancer cells from blood and/or tissue samples. This microchip might be used in remote places, low-income households, and at point-of-care such as doctors' offices, medical centers, laboratories, pharmacies, or at home. The low cost and simple USB device works on detecting telomerase, an enzyme over expressed in a variety of cancer cells. Since cancer is one of the most common causes of death, the availability of a simple and low cost portable microchip device will help on the accessibility of preventive care and cancer detection at early stages for its proper treatment. The goal of this project is to have this innovative technology available at pharmacies for its use at point-of-care and households. This microchip will be developed with carbon electrodes and polymer substrates to lower its costs and make it more cost effective to the community. This development includes flexibility, robustness, and response time.

The customers who will benefit the most from the proposed innovation are those who live far from a hospital, do not travel well due to health related issues, and do not have a strong healthcare plan or want/need to know quickly about the possibility of having cancer.  During the I-Corps program, the team intends to conduct customer discovery to assess the commercial viability of the proposed device.  If commercially viable, the proposed cancer biosensor will contribute to new scientific findings and engineering aspects in bio-sensing technology.  The resultant device will also provide a non-invasive, fast, and accurate method to detect cancer for preclinical diagnosis.

Our sensing microchip devise works by tethering a biomolecular probe on the interdigital gold electrode array surfaces. This biomolecule probe can be customized according to the target biomarker, in order to recognize and change of conformation or bond upon contact. Our sensing technology is particularly novel and unique, not only because it allows for a rapid detection of cancer cells, but also because the measurement of impedance, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, makes it potentially compatible with many electronic devices. The specific aim is to develop a robust biosensor microchip prototype using materials appropriate for commercialization.

Through the NSF I-Corps experience, we had the opportunity to talk to over 140 possible costumers and Biomedical and Health Insurance Companies as well as FDA. Our focus ended on practicing gynecologists. They that told us that patients usually arrived at our office due to abnormal vaginal bleeding and this allows them to detect the cancer at an early stage, but many other patients reach an advanced endometrial cancer stage before signs and symptoms can be noticed. Nowadays, the Pap test, which screens for cervical cancer, is one of the most reliable and effective cancer screening tests available. Studies have shown that both, incidence of, and mortality from cervical cancer has decreased by 75%. This can be attributed to the fact that every woman between the ages of 21 and 65 years old must have an annual Pap test. We are confident that our in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) device microchip biosensor can be used in a similar way, becoming a valuable screening tool to reduce the incidence of endometrial cancer.

Through our interviews, gynecologists told our i-Corps team that they see an average of 20 patients daily, and they perform an average of 10 endometrial biopsies. The insight that we got from them was that this type of technology would be very useful in terms of having a preliminary result to inform the patients instead of waiting, at least, a week or two for the biopsy results and, hopefully, eliminating this expensive test altogether. Moreover, they told us that the preliminary on-site results would help them to select which cancer tests or treatment should be given, avoiding the usual battery of testing that is requested by physicians. Although gynecologists will be our potential customers, the user archetype will be women above 21 years old until postmenopausal. Gynecologists will use our technology as part of the tests performed annually to detect any lesion in the endometrium that may develop into cancer. Doctors and patients will have an accurate, fast and simple point-of-care (POC) cancer cell detection device without the need to send samples to a pathology laboratory. Our IVD will benefit the Health Insurance companies and federal program that provides health coverage such as, Medicare and Medicaid, since several cancer tests will be avoided and an early detection will prevent costly cancer treatment.

As a major outcome has been the creation of a start-up company called BIDEA LLC and the submission of various SBIR proposals. Our last SBIR submission to NSF has been awarded. The technology presented in the SBIR proposal is being transferred from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus and the Molecular Sciences Research Building (MSRB), where it was developed. The current technology is at a stage where we need to translate the laboratory level research to a working model suitable for commercialization. The lineage of the NSF-i-Corps and NSF-SBIR proposals comes from our NSF-Chemistry Grant titled ""Label-Free Electrochemical Capacitance DNA Sensing with Passive Wireless Radio Frequency Identification Sensor Technology"" CHE-1152940. The finding obtained thought the NSF Grant allowed us to submit a patent to protect our sensing procedure (Application No.: 62/089,290, Title: ""Electrochemical Impedimetric Biosensing Microchip for Real Time Telomerase Activity Detection"", Filing Date: 12/09/2014). This was followed by the i-CORPs program participation and the NSF-SBIR BIDEA LLC proposal submission. The SBIR Phase I will provide a unique opportunity to study the viability of this microchip technology for its use as a point-of-care technology and to continue improving and understanding the science behind this biosensing system.

115,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is validating the value of using a comprehensive immune profiling technology to identify predictive biomarkers for streamlining clinical trial drug development. Targeted treatments can be very effective when matched with a responsive patient population. One way to increase treatment efficacy, reduce cost, and mitigate risk for therapies in clinical development is to sub-segment a patient population into likely responders and non-responders. This immune profiling technology has the potential to stratify patients this way by identifying predictive biomarkers that correlate with treatment. The project's focus is on immunotherapies and biologics for autoimmune diseases, two areas where the immune system activity is central to therapy success and avoidance of adverse side effects. By examining the immune profile of patients, this project hopes to identify mis-regulated cellular and gene pathways and therefore elucidate therapeutic efficacy in patients. Predicting patient response to therapies will streamline clinical trial drug approval, reduce healthcare costs on ineffective treatments, and ultimately, improve patient outcomes.

This I-Corps project is based on a powerful sequencing-based immune profiling platform for patient stratification for applications in precision medicine and drug development. This technology enables high-throughput isolation and comprehensive transcriptional profiling of individual immune cells directly from microliters of whole blood. From the data generated, high-resolution, multi-scale immune profiles are developed that present a readout of the interactions across cell types and within individual cells. These unbiased and high-dimensional profiles provide three distinct tiers of information: 1) Cellular level: the frequency of each cell type observed, 2) Module level: the transcriptional programs for inflammatory and immune pathways and 3) Gene level: individual biomarkers within each cell type. In contrast to DNA sequencing, these measurements are sensitive to cellular heterogeneity and captures the genetic and environmental factors driving the dynamic processes of disease pathogenesis and response to drug therapy. This compact representation of the immune state will enable the identifcation of features of the immune profile that are predictive of disease, drug response, and more.",NSF,4900,"REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO, THE",1855 Folsom St Ste 425,San Francisco,US,San Francisco,CA12,University of California-San Francisco,CA,941434249,47.084,7,25,2016,94878337,50000,1,31,2018,4900,I-Corps,50000,1647037,Susan Y Chen,600 16th Street,San Francisco,US,"University of California, San Francisco",941432517,Susan.Chen@ucsf.edu,Susan,Chen,Y,4154762977,@nsf.gov,8/1/2016,I-Corps: Immune Profiling for Patient Stratification in Clinical Drug Development of Autoimmune and Cancer Biologic Therapies,Grant,,,,San Francisco,CA12,CA,,,,,"Our team?s goal in participating in the NSF National Innovation Corps is to translate a technology we developed in our research labs to a commercial product with social impact. Our main objectives are to test our market hypothesis, that there is an unmet need to discover molecular signatures (or biomarkers) for the drug discovery and development pipeline, and to build a business thesis based on the product-market fit. We tested our value proposition by conducting 100+ interviews of relevant players in the pharmaceutical industry including potential customers, partners, and suppliers.
A major activity in finding our value proposition was participating in the 8-week National Innovation-Corps course in Austin, Tx. Over the course of 8 weeks, our team conducted a total of 109 interviews with bay area biotech professionals. We prioritized in person interviews conducting 57% in person conversations. We synthesized conclusions in our weekly team discussions and assessed our current business thesis (whether to pivot or not) in light of the new information from the week?s interviews. These meetings proved crucial for our functioning as a team and a real motor behind our data analysis and idea generation. We also prepared presentations to communicate our new findings at the I-Corps class each week. At week 8, we presented our final business thesis and key learnings.
Our initial hypothesis was that clinical trial coordinators at small pharma companies would be interested in patient stratification because it could increase their chances for a successful clinical trial. From our customer interviews we gathered some key insights that resulted in a few important pivots. First, we quickly learned that instead of small companies, large pharmaceutical companies were the ones who were interested and could pay for expensive patient stratification. Second, patient stratification is a major strategic decision for a company, and that decision involves an entire customer ecosystem including users, decisions makers, saboteurs and payers. Third, not all companies that rely on biomarkers need biomarker discovery.While companies may use biomarkers, they don?t necessarily need to discover new ones, so we are actually looking at a subsection of oncology companies. Fourth, time is invaluable (and is money) for pharma. We learned that customers cared about technologies that could speed up the clinical trial process by achieving ""breakthrough"" or ""accelerated"" status via effective patient stratification. From these major insights, we dramatically shifted our customer segment. Now, an essential part of the customer ecosystem was the decision maker in large pharma, either the Chief Medical Officer or project lead for a specific therapeutic. The industry that we focused on also changed to the nascent field of immuno-oncology, where they are limited to just several, poorly performing biomarkers. And our final business thesis became, ""Waypoint Bio helps Chief Medical Officers at immunotherapy companies decrease risk of clinical trial failure with a value of $8.6M"".
Some key successes of the project include ultimately finding a product market-fit and building out a full Business Model Canvas. We have also developed an expansive network of contacts and potential customers through our interviews. We also considered seed funding with an interested VC. Perhaps most intangibly, we gained an understanding of the commitment it takes to start a company. In the end, we decided to table the company for the near future. Even though we found a product-market fit, there were additional questions that we needed to answer before we could start a company. These questions include who is willing to forego scientific roles to be CEO? And what is the technical risk? And what is the timeline of success for this type of technology?
Beyond achieving a sound business thesis, this NSF grant has provided valuable opportunities for training and professional development including cultivating leadership, public speaking skills, a networking/hustling mentality, incredible organization, seamless teamwork, maintaining a constant vision, and precise execution of a plan.

Our NSF funded customer discovery has not only enabled us to find a product-market fit, but also gave us tremendous insight and skills for starting a company. If there were two take-aways our team learned from the NSF funded project when commercializing a technology, it would be: to pivot often based on data (customer interviews) and that a viable business idea is often not about the technology but about what the need is.

285,"There has been increasing concern of infections related to visit to hospitals, called hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).  HAIs have resulted in significant cases of mortality.  Approximately fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital beds, hospital room floors, and medical devices.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).  These disinfectants can clean the surfaces effectively, but in performing their disinfection functions destroy hospital equipment and materials.  In additions, these disinfectants have off putting odor and also cause irritation to eyes and skin to end users.  In this proposal, a liquid ferrate molecule, which is based on iron and oxygen atoms, is proposed to address the problems associated with currently used disinfectants.  In the laboratory, ferrate has shown tremendous potential to inactivate a wide range of microorganisms.  A recent patented liquid ferrate technology, which solved the inherent issues related to stability of ferrate in solution from, will be tested for its commercial viability as a surface disinfectant. The successful implementation of ferrate technology will decrease the cost burden to hospitals by applying safer approaches

Ferrate has been shown to be an effective oxidant, coagulant, and disinfectant for treating water and wastewater. Significantly, ferrate is a capable disinfectant due to its ability to inactivate a wide variety of microorganisms at a low dosage. Most of the research on ferrate as a disinfectant has been carried out in an aqueous environment.  Ferrate has potential in disinfecting surfaces that carry several harmful bacteria that cause HAIs.  However, no study has been performed on ferrate as a potential surface disinfectant.  This I-Corps team's main approach is to evaluate disinfection capabilities of ferrate on environmental surfaces, especially in healthcare settings.  In the proposed work, two methodologies will be applied to seek the applicability of ferrate as a disinfectant in healthcare settings.  Initially, the intensive market evaluation of surface disinfectants will be done, followed by best practice to commercialize the liquid ferrate product as a surface disinfectant for healthcare facilities.  The market evaluation will provide information whether the ferrate technology stands in comparison with currently available market disinfectant products to the health care facility customers.  Finally, the physical properties (i.e., staining of surfaces/clothes/skin, odor) and interactions with hospital materials (e.g., glass, fabric, ceramic, metal, and plastic) will be examined after the ferrate treatment.  Evaluations include visual inspection, photographs, silk tests, smell, and discoloration of material.  The proposed successful systematic investigations on technological feasibilities and market evaluation of liquid ferrate product to clean surfaces of health care facilities will demonstrate the feasibility of ferrate technology to the health care facilities.",NSF,4900,"TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM, THE",8441 RIVERSIDE PARKWAY BLDG 1 STE 3100,BRYAN,US,Brazos,TX17,The Texas A&M University System HSC,TX,77807,47.084,3,18,2016,835607441,50000,9,30,2017,4900,I-Corps,50000,1637040,Virender K Sharma,,,US,The Texas A&M University System HSC,778453424,vsharma@srph.tamhsc.edu,Virender,Sharma,K,9794369323,@nsf.gov,4/1/2016,I-Corps: Ferrate Technology in Healthcare Surfaces Disinfection,Grant,42915991,,,College Station,TX17,TX,,,,,"Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), which are related to infections related to visit to hospitals, have resulted in significant cases of mortality.  It has been reported in medical journals that about fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital room floors, hospital beds, and medical devices.  These HAIs cost an additional $39 billion to US healthcare systems. Reducing HAIs is a priority for the hospitals because of immense cost and severe penalties associated with implementation of Affordable Care Act measures.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).  These disinfectants can clean the surfaces effectively, but in performing their disinfection functions destroy hospital equipment and materials.  In additions, these disinfectants have off putting odor and also cause irritation to eyes and skin to end users.  In the project, In this proposal, a liquid ferrate solution, based on iron and oxygen atoms (tetraoxy iron in +6 oxidation state, FeVIO42-), was evaluated as a commercial product to disinfectant a variety of bacteria, generally present in hospital environment.  The liquid ferrate solution is stable for many weeks that solved inherent issues of stability of the solution and is an emerging surface disinfectant. 

 During the proposal period, commercial viability of liquid ferrate was explored by visiting sites including health care facilities.  More than hundred interviews of personnel involved in health care facilities were conducted to evaluate the viability of a liquid ferrate as a new disinfectant in market.  Results of the most of the interviews showed the critical need of environmental friendly disinfectant like ferrate that can effectively clean the facility in the hospitals in order to minimize the HAIs.  This assessment was also supported by practical use of liquid ferrate product.  However, the ferrate product needs tweaking to satisfy customer needs.  Basically, the successful implementation of liquid ferrate will decrease the cost burden to hospitals by applying safer approaches.  Two videos are available in public domains:  Technical Video:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7weDj0pWVvI; Lessons learned:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9_zN0usujo

 To support viability of liquid ferrate as a surface disinfectant, efficacy tests were conducted to inactivated three types of bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and Escherichia coli (E. coli).  The tested ferrate solution was able to inactivate these bacteria.  A stable ferrate solution was able to demonstrate antibacterial effect in disinfecting 106 organisms on a surface.  The testing further showed the practical viability of liquid ferrate as a surface disinfectant in hospital settings.  Significantly, the project also gave opportunities to educate postdoctoral on ferrate technology.  The successful ferrate technology will not only circumvent infections in hospital, but may have a role in water and wastewater treatments.

34,"This project, from Mississippi State University, establishes an I-Corps Site in the institution's Center for Entrepreneurship and Outreach (CEO).  NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The Mississippi State CEO coordinates the efforts of the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and the E-Center to administer the I-Corps Site project. The goal is to recruit and manage thirty teams a year, with the objective of creating viable businesses based on university research.

Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.

The Merced Site is in cooperation with the Bay Area NSF Innovation Corps Node through the University of California, Berkeley. Merced will cultivate both innovation and teams that can meaningfully participate in the National Innovation Network to deliver innovation to society through the application of entrepreneurship. It will also develop methods for fostering innovation-based entrepreneurship in less diverse economies. UCMerced is in a rural, agricultural area of California that has not had much entrepreneurial activity in the past. However, in 2015 UCMerced established the Venture Lab which focuses on entrepreneurship and provides a locus of entrepreneurship in the greater community.

This is a unique Sites proposal given the age of the institution and their rural location. They have already created and succeeded with their Venture Lab and recruited a 10-member Advisory Board. The leadership is very experienced and has reached out to the surrounding community for collaboration and support and their connections are strong. Their curriculum is lean-centric. UCMerced has chosen a realistic Sites model - starting with 15 Site teams the first year, then 20, ramping up to 30 in their final year of funding.

30,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a device to enable air quality and environmental engineers to collect mobile air quality data via a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle: UAV).  This will have a direct impact on a wide range of industries that are required to gather air quality data including but not limited to energy production, natural gas, and oil. This device allows engineers to create air quality models from real geospatial data rather than simulated data leading to more accurate emission values. These accurate values will allow both companies and government agencies to better track the direct effect air pollution is having on the environment and communities. The device also may be used in  identifying the environmental effects and spread of air pollution from natural disasters such as wildfires on local communities. In addition, the device may be used in military applications to determine criteria and hazardous pollutant concentrations for special use cases or battlefield scenarios. During the I-Corps program, the goal is to speak with a variety of potential customers that include air quality engineers, environmental engineers, and leak detection and repair (LDAR) supervisors as well as government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make the device adaptable across a variety of industries and use cases.

This I-Corps project is based on a previously developed mobile air quality sensor module that can be attached to UAVs to perform advanced air sampling techniques that enable geospatial data logging of pollutant concentrations in real time. The device is comprised of low-cost, high quality sensors that are interchangeable within the printable circuit board (PCB). The device has the ability to simultaneously collect the following air pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), and Lead (Pb). Combining the mobile air quality data collected by the device with unique machine learning models, new micro and macro environmental insights may be seen across the country. The proposed solution has been successfully evaluated with an alpha prototype. The device that has been developed is unique to the air quality monitoring industry and is currently not offered on the market.

During the funding period, they spent X weeks learning about the customer discovery process, completing customer interviews and communicating their findings to the NSF I-Corps team. As researchers and early entrepreneurs, the team was interested in evaluating the commercial landscape for pain points their technology could help remedy. The groups original hypothesis was their technology would enable air quality and environmental engineers to collect mobile air quality data via a drone and directly impact a wide range of industries that are required to gather air quality data including but not limited to energy production, natural gas, and oil. 

As participants, the Iconic Air team accomplished their goal completing 101 in person customer discovery interviews and 114 in total (in person, video, and phone call). The customer discovery data that was collected led them to a deeper understanding of their future customers and a completed business model canvas with validation in customer segments and value proposition sections. The final thesis read, ""Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) directors can use our system to better identify leaks so they can reduce product loss by 20%"".

The Iconic Air team travelled to over 10 cities in the US, 3 countries in Europe, and attended multiple conferences in order to achieve their 114 customer discovery interviews. The data the Iconic Air team collected during interviews led them to better understanding the industries deepest pain points and immediate needs that the technology could potentially address. Rather than gather many variations of air quality data around assets, the oil and gas industry, the EPA, and civilian communities around these factories all point to the need for better methods of monitoring methane leaks.

Iconic Airâs research completed at WVU was the basis of the technology used to form the organization. Through the NSF I-Corps program the technological developments can go beyond being an important contribution to Science and Technological Studies by more quickly deploying to the commercial marketplace.

146,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, entailing a technology based on chaotic system variability, is its ability to alter and enhance how people interact with music on and off line. By acting as a musical change agent, the proposed technology takes ""personalized music"" beyond playlists and song suggestions. For the first time, music listeners can bring their own creativity to the songs they care about. This project introduces a new paradigm for music where songs evolve and undergo transformation alone or with other songs, at the click of a button. The choice of music as an application for the technology is deliberate. Music is a highly context-dependent application where each note or musical event is determined by the preceding notes and events, and each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. That this advanced technique produces musical variations that can be analyzed as well as used for musical means suggest that the methodology could be applied to other sequences of context-dependent symbols, such as those that define image, text, film, and video. Furthermore, it can serve as an idea generator for media practitioners in general, as well as stimulate interest in engineering for students K-12 and beyond by linking science with the musical arts. 

This I-Corps project harnesses chaotic system variability to generate variations of a sequence of context-dependent symbols, such those that constitute a musical work. Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic behavior. Yet in its ""chaotic regime"", a dissipative chaotic system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions. This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output. The variant output can be close to the original work, it can mutate beyond recognition, as well as achieve degrees of variability in between these two extremes. The method includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni}, the original elements sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,....,imax. For each ""i"", a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for modification or replacement, thus becoming a ""receptor element"". A substitution or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements by varying or replacing it with a substitution element. The resulting ordered set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output. A virtually infinite set of variations is possible, each unique.

152,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to teach math in after-school or summer enrichment  settings located in under-resourced communities. This project will result in cohorts of trained college student math mentors engaging younger students in the full set of digital learning and mentoring services aimed at mathematics.  This program can be integrated into the activities of existing academic enrichment program, such as those associated with the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs and other private entities. Because the trained mentors are college students employed by the company and often already volunteering for the afterschool programs, there is incentive for such private providers to partner with the PI's team and utilize their services. Increasing standardized test scores by reinforcing classroom learning in out-of-school settings is a value proposition for school districts and schools. Parents also see the importance of their children receiving a full high school diploma, which is predicated on standardized test scores.

This I-Corps project  utilizes a game-based learning platform which uses the format of popular action games to implement math lessons.  The user interface is a three-dimensional first-person environment which can be displayed on a personal computer, mobile device or adapted to a virtual reality system.  Once in play, the scenarios given to the student teach the underlying principles behind math techniques. Gaming scenarios can compile to span full curriculums aligned with standardized tests. The digital experience is then reinforced in physical space by trained math mentors in after-school settings, Phygital Math Play rests on the premise that Physical and Digital gaming experiences can be used as motivational tools to learn mathematics in grades K-12. Just as the relational bonds between gamers is a crucial component of digital games, the mentor-mentee relationship will be developed and cultivated for physical play. An important element for this venture is building a mentoring infrastructure between institutions of higher learning and their surrounding school districts. The project team asserts that there should be no distressed school district within 20 miles of a minority-serving institution. To that end, undergraduate mentors will be trained to help reinforce the math concepts linking physical play and digital application experience to pencil-paper computation.

36,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an effective electronic solution for nursing handoffs to support accurate patient information exchange, facilitate information access at the point-of-care, eliminate redundant documentation, and increase patient safety and quality of care. Handoff in health care is defined as the communication process that transfers essential patient information among healthcare providers during patient transitions in care. The importance of nursing handoff education is validated by research findings that handoff failures have been implicated in seven out of eight novice nurses' near miss and adverse events in practice. However, there have been few handoff trainings in nursing education and these are limited or unrealistic. The challenge of creating reliable and repeatable nursing handoffs has led to delays in the competency development of students and novice nurses in navigating and collecting patient condition information, negatively impacting patient treatments. A mobile nursing handoff app may serve as a cost-effective and handy tool to provide opportunities to learn and practice nursing handoffs in an educational setting. A mobile nursing handoff app, designed with evidence-based, structured content will foster appropriate clinical judgment and ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency in handoff communication.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a mobile app for nursing handoff communications, allowing nurses to view and edit electronic patient data. Responsive web design is built in this app to be used on diverse range of sizes of mobile devices. There are multiple structures or formats for handoff communication in the health care industry; however, there are inconsistencies in the information included in these tools. This inconsistency is a particular problem for students or novice nurses who may have difficulty in identifying the necessary assessment parameters that need to be captured and reported. This app integrates nursing evidence and a well-known clinical nursing practice model to support holistic, systematic, and practical assessments of patients.  The app promotes reliable, reproducible nursing handoffs. The app has a rating system to assess and report patient acuity, and color alerts to highlight key concerns. The text data entry fields enable nurses to add notes and communicate priorities in care. Information is updated as the patient condition changes with an audit trail. The features of the app help nurses attend to significant and urgent elements of patient care and support effective and accurate nursing handoff at the bedside, leading to an increase in patient safety.

Through participation in the NSF I-Corps Program, our team conducted over 100 interviews with potential customers/stakeholders across states (e.g., nursing students, nursing faculty, nurses, leaders in academic institutions, simulation training centers, and hospitals) about current issues and desired solutions related to nursing handoff education and clinical practice. From the interviews, we discovered that nursing faculty lack tools to measure handoff communication &amp; clinical judgment skills, mainly using subjective data from preceptors/instructors. The process of learning handoff communication in pre-licensure nursing programs is often unpredictable and dependent on clinical experiences. Few electronic tools for handoff training exist in the nursing curriculum. Nursing students or novice nurses have difficulty determining assessment parameters that need to be captured/ reported. There are multiple structures or formats for handoff communication in the health care industry; 24 different handoff mnemonics. However, inconsistencies exist in information included in each section of the mnemonic in the tools.

The app has features enabling nurses and nursing students to assess and report patient acuity and color alerts to highlight key concerns and communicate priorities that need to be quickly addressed. Information is updated as the patient condition changes with an audit trail. The structure and format of the ON-SHARE? app help nurses attend to the most significant and urgent elements of patient care.

In practice, handoff failures have been implicated in seven out of eight novice nurses' near misses and adverse events. As we discovered, substantive tools for handoff training have been limited in most clinical nursing education. In clinical practice, faculty and students have limited or no access to patients' electronic health records. This challenge has led to delays in the competency development of students and novice nurses in navigating and collecting patient condition information in clinical settings, negatively impacting safe handoff. Our interviews found that nursing students expressed only 10% confidence in nursing handoff and wanted a product that gives feedback on how well they are doing handoff. Nursing faculty wanted an effective tool to evaluate and monitor patient handoff performances of nursing students in either simulation settings or clinical practicum. We discovered and built potential channels to introduce and implement the app to nursing academic institutions and nursing residency programs in hospitals. The ON-SHARE? app, along with clinical simulation cases, will significantly help students and novice nurses collect appropriate information, synthesize patient data, promote an understanding of patient problems and situations, plan interventions, monitor outcomes, and develop safe handoff practices.
